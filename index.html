      Hey love,<br><br>

      It’s been three years, and somehow it still feels like I’m
      discovering new reasons to fall for you every single day.
      From the smallest laughs to the toughest moments,
      you’ve been my constant, my calm, and my chaos in the best way.<br><br>

      Thank you for choosing me, even when I’m difficult.
      Thank you for loving me the way you do.
      I don’t know what the future looks like,
      but I know I want it with you.<br><br>

      Always yours ❤️
    </p>
