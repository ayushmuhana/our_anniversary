      Dear Dhannooo,<br><br>

      It’s been three years, and somehow it still feels like I’m discovering new things about you every single day. And every new thing I discover,
      is a new thing I love about you. Infact, there are so many things I love about you, I can't even begin. 
      I love how cute you are when you are sleepy. I love the different adorable noises you make
      depending on what mood you are in! I love how when you get sad, but you make a brave face but it's so evident how badly you just want to cry.
      I love your beautiful morning look, your casually pretty afternoon look, and not to forget, your elegant nighttime date look. (Some other looks I 
      shall not mention hehe). <br><br>
      
      I am so glad you are part of my life cause I really can't imagine telling the weird things in my head to anyone else.
      I can't imagine who else I can do the <em>kalesh</em> with. I can't imagine who else can I get jealous over, who else I can complain about that jealousy!
      From the smallest laughs to the toughest moments, you’ve been my constant, my calm, and my chaos in the best way. <br><br>

      Thank you for choosing me, even when I’m difficult.
      Thank you for loving me the way you do.
      I don’t know what the future looks like,
      but I know I want it with you.<br><br>

      Always yours 💗
    </p>
